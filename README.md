## High-Availability AWS Solution for Centralized Identity in Banks or Umbrella companies managing newly acquired entities.

## Overview

A company that acquires banks needs a way to connect each bank’s AWS account to a central VPC. This allows employees from different banks to log into a central identity system and access shared resources. However, the banks must remain isolated from each other for security and compliance.

To achieve this, Here is the list of Requirements:

### Identity & Access Management (IAM) Requirements

- Centralized Authentication: All bank employees must log into a single, central identity solution
- Role-Based Access Control: Employees should only have access to their bank's AWS resources
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): The system must enforce MFA for authentication to meet security and compliance standards.
- Support for External Identity Providers (Optional): If banks already use Active Directory (AD) or third-party identity providers (Okta, Azure AD), the system should support integration.
- Centralized User Management: Administrators should be able to manage users centrally across all AWS accounts under the umbrella organization.

### Network Connectivity Requirements

- Connect Each Bank’s AWS Network to a Central VPC: Each bank’s AWS VPC must be securely connected to a central VPC that hosts the identity solution.
- Prevent Inter-Bank Communication: Compliance regulations prohibit one bank from accessing another bank’s AWS account. Thus, each bank should be fully isolated from other banks at the network level.
- Use AWS Native Networking Services: The solution must use AWS services like AWS Transit Gateway, AWS PrivateLink, or VPC Peering.

### Security & Compliance Requirements

- Zero Trust Security Model: Each bank must be restricted from accessing other banks’ accounts and must only communicate with the central identity solution.
- Logging & Monitoring: The system must log authentication attempts, failed logins, and any unauthorized access attempts.
- Encryption & Data Protection: All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted using AWS Key Management Service and TLS.
- Compliance with Banking Security Standards: The solution must align with PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR, or other banking security requirements.

## High Availability & Scalability Requirements

- Multi-AZ Deployment: The identity solution and network architecture must be deployed across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) to prevent downtime.
- Multi-Region Redundancy (Optional for Disaster Recovery): If needed, the architecture should support failover to a secondary AWS region for disaster recovery.
- Scalability for Future Acquisitions: The system should have an automated onboarding to allow newly acquired banks to be onboarded easily without redesigning the architecture.

### AWS Organization & Account Structure Requirements

- Centralized AWS Account Management: Each bank's AWS account should be managed under a single AWS Organization controlled by the umbrella company.
- Service Control Policies (SCPs) for Security: AWS Organizations SCPs should enforce access restrictions
- Centralized Billing & Governance: The umbrella company should control billing, cost tracking, and security compliance centrally for all bank accounts.

## Introduction
This document describes a **multi-account architecture** in AWS designed to host multiple banks (or tenants) securely. It explains how to:

- Use **AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)** as a **hub-and-spoke** for network connectivity.  
- Enforce strict isolation (no direct traffic) between bank accounts.  
- Centralize security, compliance, and identity management.  
- Achieve high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), and optionally multiple regions.  
- Automate onboarding of new bank accounts with **Terraform**.  

The goal is to meet **bank-grade security and compliance** requirements while making management straightforward and scalable.
